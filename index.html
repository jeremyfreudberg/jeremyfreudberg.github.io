<h1>Jeremy Freudberg</h1>
<p>
I am an undergraduate student at Boston University, studying computer science and linguistics.
I will graduate in May 2019.
You can find out about my accomplishments, credentials, and interests here; otherwise, you may wish to <a href="#" onclick="alert('Coming soon')">download my resume</a> (perhaps best suited to a technical audience).
</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>
<u>Software Engineering Intern, <i>Massachusetts Open Cloud</i></u><br />
Most of my efforts at the MOC are devoted to Big Data as a Service (Cloud Dataverse, OpenStack Sahara, and beyond) and federated clouds (in particular, federated networking).
In the past I also was involved in the monitoring of the MOC.
Additionally, sometimes I find myself doing UI/UX stuff, writing Puppet manifests, and doing miscellaneous code review.
</p>
<p>
<u>Active Techinical Contributor and Core Reviewer, <i>OpenStack Sahara</i></u><br />
Especially since the beginning of its "Pike" development cycle, I have been heavily involved in the OpenStack Sahara project, which is a service providing Big Data processing on OpenStack (cluster provisioning and job submission).
You can see what I'm up to through Stackalytics, but honestly the importance of that kind of statistic is overblown so I won't link it here.
Just know that I provide a huge amount of code review, as well as contributing bug fixes and new features focused on UX, flexibility, and new integrations.
I'm also slightly involved on the downstream side of things for Sahara with Red Hat.

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
I like linguistics, and I always point out that every linguistics fact is a fun fact.
I'm allegedly interested in computational linguistics, although I haven't done much with that.
Some day I would like to know more about the phonology (NOT phonetics) of singing.
Historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and morphology (bonus points if you intersect all three) are also neat.
</p>
<p>
I find myself reading Wiktionary way too often.
</p>
<p>
I'm not exactly a diehard FOSS user (I do use Windows!), but that stuff is really important.
It's great that OpenStack is on the scene, and I try to stay on top of the goings-on of cloud.
</p>
<p>
I play the double-reeds, mainly oboe, English horn, and bassoon.
I listen to a lot of classical music, but not only classical.
</p>
<p>
Geography is great.
I read Google Maps even more than Wiktionary.
I memorize streets, and like to look for "secrets" like abandoned or undeveloped rights-of-way.
I think a lot about public transit in the US also.
</p>
<p>
I'm not much of a world-traveller, but it's worth noting that (beyond my home country) I have been to and enjoyed Canada, the Bahamas, Ireland, Northern Ireland (UK), Cuba, and the Azores (Portugal).
I hope to augment this list in the near future.
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>
There is various media (photos, videos, written works) of me online, and all of it embarrasses me to some extent.
Regardless, please enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16hRBms24xA" target="_blank">my talk at the May 2017 OpenStack Summit</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UG_fT_NzkE" target="_blank">me on Cuban national television</a>.
</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have any amount of Internet-fu, you can find my contact details (and more) incredibly easily.
