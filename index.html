<h1>Jeremy Freudberg</h1>
<p>
I recently graduated from Boston University, where I earned a B.A. in linguistics and computer science.
Now I am a software engineer at Red Hat, improving support for OpenStack on architectures beyond x86.
</p>
<p>
Broadly stated, my interests lie simultaneously in cloud computing, linguistics, geography, and double-reeds.
