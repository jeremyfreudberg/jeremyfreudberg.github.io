<h4>Jeremy’s tips to remembering some of the obscure or similar-looking IPA symbols</h4>
<p>
<ul>ɟ vs. ʝ: ɟ is crossed out = “stop!” = stop</ul>
<ul>ɳ vs. ɲ vs. ŋ: ɳ has a retroflex tail, ɲ is built out of a j, ŋ has the tail of a g</ul>
<ul>ʀ vs ʁ: ʀ compared with ʙ → both are trills</ul>
<ul>ⱱ: a combination of v and ɾ; ʋ is just a weird v -- in fact, it’s approximately a v (and not built out of a flap)</ul>
<ul>Can’t remember if ç and ʝ are the palatal stops or palatal fricatives? Think fricative = french orthography (for ç) or fancy (for both)</ul>
<ul>ɣ is the voiced velar fricative because it is a gamma</ul>
<ul>ɰ and ɯ are both a modified w, but how do you remember which is the vowel and which is the (velar) approximant? Think approximant corresponds to ɰ, which is only approximately a w</ul>
<ul>Can’t remember the manner of articulation for ʎ? (We know it’s a lateral something because lambda = l.) Think approximant, because it’s a backwards lambda, which only approximately a real lambda</ul>
<ul>Can’t remember the place of articulation for ʎ? (We know it’s a lateral something because lambda = l.) Well, a lambda is also a symbol used a lot in CS237, a class taught by Prof. Gacs, who is/speaks Hungarian, a language with palatal sounds</ul>
<ul>ʘ is a bilabial click because bilabial is the closest articulation to your eyeballs!</ul>
<ul>ǀ is a dental click because it’s a straight line → think straight...straight tooth… orthodontic...dental</ul>
<ul>ǃ is an alveolar click because alveolar sounds are really common, so they steal the show, i.e. they are flamboyant/exciting/etc.</ul>
<ul>ǂ is a palato-alveolar click because it is at the crossroads of the two places</ul>
<ul>ǁ is a lateral alveolar click because it’s a more exciting l… so exciting that you need to bring a friend (the second l)</ul>
<ul>̺  is apical… at the apex of a curve you start falling down (so ̪  must be dental)</ul>
<ul>̻  is laminal because it’s like you’ve laminated a piece of paper</ul>
<ul>Remembering the height of ø / œ / ɶ… think about how much vowel would weigh… a single character is lightest, then two lowercase, then two uppercase… the lighter ones float away up into the sky… sky high</ul>
<ul>Can’t remember what the rounded high-mid central vowel is? No problem (if you can remember one of the other rounded high-mid vowels). Just remember (from front to back) ø → ɵ → o. (Sorry I don’t have a “funny” way for this one)</ul>
<ul>The confusing question marks (given that you know ʔ for reference)
<ul>
<li>ʢ → this is the exact opposite of glottal stop (backwards and crossed out instead of forwards and uncrossed), so it must be an epiglottal fricative (=not stop)</li>
<li>ʡ → this must be the epiglottal stop, because crossed out (“stop!”) and faces the same way as glottal [alternatively, this is just the glottal stop getting stabbed with an “epi-pen”]</li>
<li>ʕ → this must be some kind pharyngeal (it’s a voiced stop) because it’s backwards, i.e. different, i.e. not having a cross out or facing the right way, i.e. not containing the word “glottal” in its name</li>
<li>ħ and ʜ might be obvious enough now by process of elimination</li>
</ul>
</ul>
